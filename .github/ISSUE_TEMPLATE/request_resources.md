<!-- Hi, good luck with the webinars and fingers crossed! For one off/time limited events we can usually raise the limit.
Could you please create a new issue to help us keep track of this? In the issue please mention:
-->
### 1. Who you are
### 2. A few details about the event/course/context
### 3. If money is changing hands (attendees pay a fee, speaker is getting paid, free, etc)
### 4. A link to the repository you are using
### 5. What type of event it is:
- [ ] talk
- [ ] workshop
- [ ] lecture course
- [ ] training session

### 6. How many people you expect to attend the event
### 7. The exact times and dates of the event(s) (with timezone information)
<!-- It would be great if you could notify us >48H ahead of the event -->
### 8. If you plan to advertise mybinder as the service running the event

<!-- That would be great as it gives us all the information we need to make a decision and set things up.
It also allows us to track our impact which will be useful when we report to those who fund mybinder.org or seek new funding.
